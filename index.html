      <p>Welcome to the Sekai! These places called “Sekais” are located in the fictional world of “Hatsune Miku: Colorful Stage.”</p>
      <p>Each Sekai is created by a group’s emotions. The strongest emotion shapes the world and chooses the leader.These places called “Sekai’s” are located in the fictional world of “Hatsume Miku: Colorful Stage”. This document will outline all the different Sekai’s and what they all need/have in each of them. 

Each individual Sekai is created by a group of peoples feelings, with one member of the groups feeling’s strongest making them the leader of said group. These feelings help shape and create the Sekais in each groups unique path.</p>
      <p>Despite differing musical styles, all Sekais share common mechanics and elements.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Units">
      <header>Units</header>
      <p>Each Sekai is made up of four different people and each of their respective goals and dreams is what make the Sekai appear in the first place. The Unit takes on the form of whichever type of music the group wants to perform. Along with the four members there are also people known as Vitural Singers in each Sekai. They only exsit in the Sekai and are there to help each unit grow more and more through music. </p>
      <p>The groups reflect different genres: rock, idol pop, rap, musical theater, and melancholic ballads.</p>

      <header>Types</header>
      <p>With this everything in each Sekai has an “attribute” that is connected to it. The items in question are the decorations and the plants, but we will get into more of that later. The types of attributes include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Happy</li>
        <li>Pure</li>
        <li>Cute</li>
        <li>Cool</li>
        <li>Mysterious</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Each attribute is connected to one plant and one decoration element. These are also connected with each character of the Sekai and help boost their skills when they are applied during shows.</p>
      <p><code>let "cool" attribute = Boost;</code></p>
